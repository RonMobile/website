# Origin

We are R enthustiasts. We use R in work and in private. Once Adam bought tablet (with Android). The question was: 'Where is R? Can we install R on tablet and mobile phone? And is it simple?'

So there is no R on Android (and on nOS of course). There is no R app on GoogleStore or AppStore. Really?! Why? It should be, shouldn't be? We are R guys, so we are really suprised :).

So we wanted to install R just like that. And it is not. The good news is that it can be done. 
We found out tha it is not simple - and this is the bad news.

# R on Mobile - what for?

We are R guys. So if we would be on the Moon we would like to take R with us. We do not need to have the reason. But others do.

Mobile devices
